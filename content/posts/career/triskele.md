As a security consultant, my role was to perform penetration tests on clients to identify potential vulnerabilities within their systems and report on these isses to the client. I spent most of my time performing testing on a range of different platforms including:

- Web Applications
- External Networks
- Internal Networks

- iOS Mobile Applications

Alongside testing these platforms, my role's responsibility also included:
