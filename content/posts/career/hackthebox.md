## Sales Engineer

This role was pretty left field for me, I can't say I was expecting to work in a technical sales role. After years of using Hack the Box to start my career, I had to apply to work for the company that I used to build my cyber security career. As a Sales Engineer, my role wass to provide technical support to the sales team in APAC. Some of my responsibilities included:

- Developing technical training for the sales team
- Educating the sales team of upcoming features and content that is added to the platform
- Staying on top of current technical events, breaches and popular exploits
- Running technical demos and workshops for customers
- Managing and delivering the platform for trials or after purchase
- Providing technical support in customer facing meetings and sales calls
