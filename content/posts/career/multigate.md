## IT Support Officer

My main role was to provide IT support to the 100+ onsite staff and 40+ offsite staff for both Multigate and their sister company MDevices. Although a lot of my role was general support issues, there was a lot of flexibility for me to complete tasks that a System Administrator would otherwise complete.

## Security Administrator

After being in my role for over a year I was promoted to my new role which consisted of my previous work along with some additional security responsibilities (firewall configuration, Active Directory permissions, etc.). I spent a lot of time in this role automating my previous tasks and fixing security issues within both companies.
