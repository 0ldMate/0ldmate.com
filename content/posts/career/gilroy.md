## Information Technology Support

Over the period of two years I was one of three IT support staff at Gilroy College whilst I was completing a Certificate IV in Information Technology Networking at TAFE. My role was mainly focused on providing support to over 1,200 staff and students on site. Support ranged from simple computer issues and printer problems to server and system updates.
