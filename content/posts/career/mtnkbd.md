## Owner

What started out as a place to sell a custom keyboard I designed blew into a wild journey that has had many of challenges. [Mtn Kbd (formerly Mountain Keyboards)](https://mtnkbd.com/) is a custom mechanical keyboard store that is run from Sydney. What was once a small store of a handful of items has now blown up into a small business I'm glad to have started. 

Throughout this journey I have had to learn a variety of things including:

- Managing and storing stocked items
- Packing and shipping items consistently
- Managing customer relations
- Building a community
- Managing finances
- Organising freight from several countries via air and sea
- Marketing and designing new products
- Creating a website and blog posts

Fortunately, this store has grown successfully to a point where I have learned many, many lessons that I can take forward into future projects. I love being able to share knowledge and insight on this business wherever possible. Though I don't plan on running this business in the long term, it has been quite the journey thus far and I'm interested to see where this goes.
